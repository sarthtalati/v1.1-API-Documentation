# Points
Points represent loyalty points of an organization that are issued to the loyalty customers through different sources such as Loyalty Manager, Data Import (import profiles) and Member Care (GoodWill points). Customers can redeem their points against transactions. 

<aside class="warning"> 
Points cannot be issued through APIs. It can be issued only through modules such as Loyalty Manager, Data Import and Member Care. 
</aside>

The APIs of points entity are interdependent. For example, to redeem points, first you need to check whether a customer can redeem those points (`isredeemable`), validate customer's registered mobile number by issuing validation code, and then redeem points using the validation code received by the customer.

The points entity allows you to perform the following tasks:

* Check whether a specific number of points can be redeemed by a customer  
* Issue validation code to the registered mobile number/email id to validate customer 
* Redeem points using the validation code received by the customer

## Check If Points are Redeemable

Customers can redeem their active points according to the redemption criteria set for the organization (Loyalty Program). For example, I could set redemption criteria as allow redemption only in multiples of 10 and a maximum of 200 points per time.

This API lets you verify whether a specific number of points can be redeemed by a customer. With this API, you can now issue validation code to the customer  automatically upon successful validation. This will reduce an additional step of calling points/validationcode API to issue validation code.

<aside class="notice">
* If there is any problem in issuing validation code, Points Redeemable but OTP Generation failed error will be displayed (876)

* if points validation itself fails, then the relevant error message will be displayed

Before making `points/redeem` API call, you need to validate the customer by issuing validation code to the registered mobile number/email id. 

This API allows you to issue a dynamic validation code to the customer's registered mobile number/email id which is required to pass while redeeming points. The validation code is valid only for a specific time period post which it expires automatically. If you try to issue validation code within the validity period, same code will be issued again.

The validity period and communicate via is set on the **OTPConfigurations** page of InTouch > **Settings** > **Organization Setup**

* **OTP code validity period**: The validity of the validation code in minutes
* **Communicate OTP Via**: Mode of sending the validation code, email/sms/both

<aside class="notice"> 
The validation code is issued either to mobile number, or email id or both, based on the configuration set on the page InTouch > Settings > Organization Setup > OTPConfigurations
